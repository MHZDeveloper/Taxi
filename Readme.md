# TAXI
Hello everyone for this mini project called "Taxi" (Cab) which for the moment is based on the addition and deletion of cabs by the user.

A cab is characterized by the name of the **driver** as well as the **identification number** that follows the pattern (###-TUN-####). 
And of course we have designed the necessary tests to support this pattern.

There is also a fake config which represents a fake database and which will be manipulated in the service layer.

Finally we have exposed 3 REST services (GET, POST, DELETE) to manipulate cabs through an intermediate representation (DTO) of a cab.
